# Q4: . List all queue function operations available for manipulation of data elements in c

### Solution
Here are common queue operations available for manipulating data elements in C:

1) enqueue(data): Adds an element to the end(Rear) of the queue.

2) dequeue(): Removes and returns the element at the front of the queue.

3) peek(): Returns the element at the front of the queue without removing it.

4) isEmpty(): Checks if the queue is empty(Front = Rear =NULL).

5) size(): Returns the number of elements in the queue.

6) clear(): Empties the queue, removing all elements.
